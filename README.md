This is a simple web page I made for a friend who plays Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It allows the user to find out what cooking recipes they can make with the ingredients in their inventory.

This is my first web project, and I will be occasionally updating it with fixes, new features, and improved visuals.

The page is hosted at http://theblackmezek.pythonanywhere.com/
